# 100 SQL Fundamental Interview Questions and Answers


### 1. What is SQL?
**Answer:**  
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, deleting data, and creating and modifying database structures.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

---

### 2. What is a primary key?
**Answer:**  
A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a database table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and helps to establish relationships between tables. A primary key cannot contain NULL values.
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(100)
);
```

---

### 3. What is a foreign key?
**Answer:**  
A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It creates a relationship between the two tables and enforces referential integrity.
```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```

---

### 4. What is a JOIN in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Common types of JOINs include:
- **INNER JOIN**
- **LEFT JOIN**
- **RIGHT JOIN**
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**
```sql
-- INNER JOIN
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;

-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;

-- RIGHT JOIN
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;

-- FULL OUTER JOIN
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

---

### 5. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?
**Answer:**  
- **INNER JOIN:** Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables involved in the join. If there are no matching rows, the result is null.
- **OUTER JOIN:** Includes all rows from one table and the matching rows from the other table. If there is no match, it returns null for the columns from the table without a match. This can be further divided into:
  - **LEFT JOIN:** Includes all rows from the left table.
  - **RIGHT JOIN:** Includes all rows from the right table.
```sql
-- INNER JOIN
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;

-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;

-- RIGHT JOIN
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;

-- FULL OUTER JOIN
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

---

### 6. What is a subquery?
**Answer:**  
A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It is used to perform intermediate steps in complex queries, often for filtering results or performing calculations that are then used by the main query.
```sql
-- Subquery to find employees with salary greater than the average salary
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

---

### 7. How do you handle NULL values in SQL?
**Answer:**  
- **Using `COALESCE`:** Replace NULL values with a specified value.
- **Filtering out NULLs:** Use a condition in the WHERE clause to exclude rows with NULL values, e.g., `WHERE column IS NOT NULL`.
```sql
-- Using COALESCE to replace NULL values
SELECT COALESCE(salary, 0) FROM employees;

-- Filtering out NULLs
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### 8. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?
**Answer:**  
- **DELETE:** Removes specified rows from a table based on a condition and can be rolled back if used within a transaction. It also fires any associated triggers.
- **TRUNCATE:** Removes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions and cannot be rolled back in most databases. TRUNCATE is faster than DELETE and resets any identity columns.
```sql
-- DELETE
DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id = 1;

-- TRUNCATE
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
```

---

### 9. What is a stored procedure?
**Answer:**  
A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements stored in the database. It is used to encapsulate repetitive tasks, improve performance by reducing the need to compile SQL code multiple times, and enhance security by controlling access to data.
```sql
-- Example of a stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees;
END;
```

---

### 10. What is indexing in SQL?
**Answer:**  
Indexing is a technique used to improve the performance of SQL queries by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned. An index is created on a table column, and it helps the database to find rows more quickly and efficiently.
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees(name);
```

---

### 11. What is normalization in SQL?
**Answer:**  
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them. Common normalization forms include:
- **1NF (First Normal Form)**
- **2NF (Second Normal Form)**
- **3NF (Third Normal Form)**
- **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**
```sql
-- Example of normalization (1NF to 3NF)
-- 1NF: Single table with redundant data
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(100),
    department_location VARCHAR(100)
);

-- 2NF: Removing partial dependencies
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    location VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);

-- 3NF: Removing transitive dependencies
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE locations (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    location VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```
---

### 12. What is denormalization?
**Answer:**  
Denormalization is the process of combining normalized tables to improve read performance. It involves adding redundant data to one or more tables to avoid complex joins and improve query execution time.
```sql
-- Example of denormalization: combining two tables into one
CREATE TABLE employee_details (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(100),
    department_location VARCHAR(100)
);
```
---

### 13. What is a view in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL query. It contains rows and columns just like a real table and can be used to simplify complex queries, enhance security by restricting access to specific data, and present data in a specific format.
```sql
-- Example of creating a view
CREATE VIEW employee_departments AS
SELECT employees.name, departments.name AS department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```
---

### 14. How do you create a view in SQL?
**Answer:**  
To create a view, use the `CREATE VIEW` statement followed by the view name and the `AS` keyword with the SELECT query. Example:
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_departments AS
SELECT employees.name, departments.name AS department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```
---

### 15. What is a trigger in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A trigger is a stored procedure that automatically executes in response to certain events on a particular table or view. Triggers can be used for enforcing business rules, validating input data, and maintaining audit trails.
```sql
-- Example of a trigger
CREATE TRIGGER trgAfterInsert ON employees
FOR INSERT
AS
BEGIN
    PRINT 'New employee record inserted';
END;
```
---

### 16. What is a transaction in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations treated as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure data integrity by following the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). A transaction can be started with the `BEGIN TRANSACTION` statement and completed with `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`.
```sql
-- Example of a transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department) VALUES (2, 'Jane Doe', 'Finance');
COMMIT;
```
---

### 17. What is the difference between COMMIT and ROLLBACK?
**Answer:**  
- **COMMIT:** Saves all changes made in the transaction to the database permanently.
- **ROLLBACK:** Reverts all changes made in the transaction, restoring the database to its previous state before the transaction began.
```sql
-- Example of COMMIT
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department) VALUES (3, 'Mike Smith', 'IT');
COMMIT;

-- Example of ROLLBACK
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department) VALUES (4, 'Anna Johnson', 'HR');
ROLLBACK;
```
---

### 18. What are aggregate functions in SQL?
**Answer:**  
Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows of a table and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include:
- **SUM()**: Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
- **AVG()**: Calculates the average value of a numeric column.
- **COUNT()**: Counts the number of rows.
- **MIN()**: Finds the minimum value in a column.
- **MAX()**: Finds the maximum value in a column.
```sql
-- Example of aggregate functions
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(salary), MAX(salary), MIN(salary), SUM(salary)
FROM employees;
```
---

### 19. What is the GROUP BY clause in SQL?
**Answer:**  
The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. It is often used with aggregate functions to perform calculations on each group. Example:
```sql
-- Example of GROUP BY
SELECT department, COUNT(*), AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```
---

### 20. What is the HAVING clause in SQL?
**Answer:**  
The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups of rows created by the `GROUP BY` clause based on a specified condition. Unlike the `WHERE` clause, which filters individual rows, `HAVING` filters groups. Example:
```sql
-- Example of HAVING
SELECT department, COUNT(*), AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```

---

### 21. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clause?
**Answer:**  
- **WHERE Clause:** Filters individual rows before any groupings are made. It cannot be used with aggregate functions.
- **HAVING Clause:** Filters groups of rows after the `GROUP BY` clause. It can be used with aggregate functions.
```sql
-- Example of WHERE
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

-- Example of HAVING
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```
---

### 22. What is a UNION operator in SQL?
**Answer:**  
The `UNION` operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT queries. Each SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of columns in the result sets with similar data types. It removes duplicate rows between the various SELECT statements.
```sql
-- Example of UNION
SELECT name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT name FROM managers;
```
---

### 23. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?
**Answer:**  
- **UNION:** Combines the result sets of two or more SELECT queries and removes duplicate rows.
- **UNION ALL:** Combines the result sets of two or more SELECT queries and includes duplicate rows.
```sql
-- Example of UNION
SELECT name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT name FROM managers;

-- Example of UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM managers;
```
---

### 24. What is the purpose of the DISTINCT keyword in SQL?
**Answer:**  
The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate rows from the result set of a SELECT query. It ensures that the returned results contain only unique values.
```sql
-- Example of DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
```
---

### 25. What are the different types of SQL commands?
**Answer:**  
SQL commands are divided into several categories:
- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Includes commands like CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Includes commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- **DCL (Data Control Language):** Includes commands like GRANT, REVOKE.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Includes commands like COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT.
- **DQL (Data Query Language):** Primarily includes the SELECT command.
```sql
-- Example of DDL command
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Example of DML command
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'HR');

-- Example of DCL command
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user_name;

-- Example of TCL command
COMMIT;
```
---

### 26. What is a constraint in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A constraint is a rule applied to a column or a table to enforce data integrity and consistency. Common types of constraints include:
- **NOT NULL**
- **UNIQUE**
- **PRIMARY KEY**
- **FOREIGN KEY**
- **CHECK**
- **DEFAULT**
```sql
-- Example of constraints
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    department_id INT,
    salary DECIMAL CHECK (salary > 0),
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```
---

### 27. What is a schema in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A schema is a logical container for database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and procedures. It helps organize and manage database objects and can also provide a level of security by allowing different users to access specific schemas.
```sql
-- Example of creating a schema
CREATE SCHEMA sales;
CREATE TABLE sales.employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(100)
);
```
---

### 28. What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types?
**Answer:**  
- **CHAR:** A fixed-length character data type. It always uses the specified number of bytes, regardless of the length of the stored string.
- **VARCHAR:** A variable-length character data type. It uses only as many bytes as necessary to store the string, up to the specified maximum length.
```sql
-- Example of CHAR and VARCHAR
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_code CHAR(10),
    product_name VARCHAR(100)
);
```
---

### 29. What is a composite key?
**Answer:**  
A composite key is a combination of two or more columns in a table that together serve as a unique identifier for a record. Each column in the composite key can contain duplicate values, but the combination of all columns must be unique.
```sql
-- Example of a composite key
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)
);
```
---

### 30. What is referential integrity?
**Answer:**  
Referential integrity is a property that ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent. When one table has a foreign key that points to another table, referential integrity ensures that the foreign key value matches a primary key value in the referenced table, or is NULL.
```sql
-- Example of referential integrity
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```
---

### 31. What is an alias in SQL?
**Answer:**  
An alias is a temporary name given to a table or column for the duration of a SQL query. It is used to make column names more readable and to simplify complex queries.
```sql
-- Example of an alias
SELECT e.name AS employee_name, d.name AS department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```
---

### 32. What is a default constraint in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A default constraint is used to set a default value for a column when no value is specified during an insert operation. It ensures that the column always contains a value.
```sql
-- Example of a default constraint
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'General'
);
```
---

### 33. What is the difference between a clustered and a non-clustered index?
**Answer:**  
- **Clustered Index:** Sorts and stores the data rows in the table based on the index key. There can be only one clustered index per table.
- **Non-Clustered Index:** Creates a separate structure from the data rows. The index contains pointers to the data rows. There can be multiple non-clustered indexes per table.
```sql
-- Example of clustered and non-clustered index
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Clustered index on the primary key
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_id ON employees(id);

-- Non-clustered index on the name column
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_name ON employees(name);
```
---

### 34. What is a candidate key in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A candidate key is a column, or a set of columns, that can uniquely identify a row in a table. A table can have multiple candidate keys, but one of them will be chosen as the primary key.
```sql
-- Example of candidate keys
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    ssn VARCHAR(11),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    UNIQUE (ssn),
    UNIQUE (email)
);
```
---

### 35. What is a self-join?
**Answer:**  
A self-join is a join in which a table is joined with itself. It is useful for querying hierarchical data or comparing rows within the same table.
```sql
-- Example of a self-join
SELECT e1.name AS employee_name, e2.name AS manager_name
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id;
```
---

### 36. What is a sequence in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A sequence is a database object that generates a sequence of unique numeric values according to a specified increment. Sequences are commonly used to generate unique primary key values.
```sql
-- Example of a sequence
CREATE SEQUENCE emp_sequence
START WITH 1
INCREMENT BY 1;

-- Using the sequence to insert data
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department)
VALUES (NEXT VALUE FOR emp_sequence, 'John Doe', 'HR');
```
---

### 37. What is the purpose of the LIKE operator in SQL?
**Answer:**  
The `LIKE` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. It is often used with wildcards:
- `%` represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
- `_` represents a single character.
```sql
-- Example of LIKE operator
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
```
---

### 38. What is a synonym in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A synonym is an alias or alternative name for a database object such as a table, view, sequence, or stored procedure. Synonyms make it easier to reference objects and can help with database schema management.
```sql
-- Example of creating a synonym
CREATE SYNONYM emp FOR employees;
SELECT * FROM emp;
```
---

### 39. What is data integrity?
**Answer:**  
Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data stored in a database. It is maintained through the use of constraints, triggers, and transactions to ensure that the data remains valid and consistent.
```sql
-- Example of data integrity using constraints
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```
---

### 40. What is the ACID property in SQL?
**Answer:**  
The ACID properties ensure reliable processing of database transactions:
- **Atomicity:** Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully; otherwise, the transaction is aborted.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
- **Isolation:** Ensures that the operations of one transaction are isolated from those of other transactions.
- **Durability:** Ensures that the results of a committed transaction are permanently saved in the database.
```sql
-- Example of a transaction demonstrating ACID properties
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department) VALUES (5, 'Robert Brown', 'Sales');
COMMIT;
```

---

### 41. What is the purpose of the ORDER BY clause in SQL?
**Answer:**  
The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set of a query by one or more columns. By default, it sorts in ascending order; however, it can also sort in descending order using the `DESC` keyword.
```sql
-- Example of ORDER BY
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
```
---

### 42. What is a unique key in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A unique key is a constraint that ensures all values in a column or a set of columns are unique across the table. Unlike the primary key, a table can have multiple unique keys, and unique keys can contain NULL values.
```sql
-- Example of a unique key
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```
---

### 43. What is the purpose of the CASE statement in SQL?
**Answer:**  
The `CASE` statement is used to create conditional logic in SQL queries. It allows you to return different values based on specified conditions, similar to an if-else statement in programming languages.
```sql
-- Example of CASE statement
SELECT name,
    CASE
        WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 'High'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 50000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS salary_level
FROM employees;
```
---

### 44. What is the purpose of the LIMIT clause in SQL?
**Answer:**  
The `LIMIT` clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query. It is often used in conjunction with the `ORDER BY` clause to return a subset of the result set.
```sql
-- Example of LIMIT
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 10;
```
---

### 45. What is a cross join in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A cross join, also known as a Cartesian join, returns the Cartesian product of the two tables involved in the join. This means it returns all possible combinations of rows from the two tables.
```sql
-- Example of CROSS JOIN
SELECT employees.name, departments.name AS department_name
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
```
---

### 46. What is the difference between an alias and a synonym in SQL?
**Answer:**  
- **Alias:** A temporary name given to a table or column in a SQL query for the duration of that query.
- **Synonym:** A permanent alias for a database object, which remains until explicitly dropped.
```sql
-- Example of alias
SELECT e.name AS employee_name, d.name AS department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- Example of synonym
CREATE SYNONYM emp FOR employees;
SELECT * FROM emp;
```
---

### 47. What is the difference between SQL and PL/SQL?
**Answer:**  
- **SQL:** A standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases.
- **PL/SQL:** A procedural language extension for SQL, used in Oracle databases to write complex scripts and functions.
```sql
-- Example of PL/SQL procedure
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails
IS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees;
END;
/
```
---

### 48. What is a foreign key constraint in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A foreign key constraint is a rule that maintains referential integrity between two tables. It ensures that the value in a foreign key column matches a value in the primary key column of the referenced table.
```sql
-- Example of foreign key constraint
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```
---

### 49. What is the purpose of the NVL function in SQL?
**Answer:**  
The `NVL` function is used to replace NULL values with a specified value. It is commonly used to ensure that calculations and operations are performed correctly even when some data is missing.
```sql
-- Example of NVL function
SELECT name, NVL(salary, 0) AS salary
FROM employees;
```
---

### 50. What is a subquery in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It is used to perform intermediate steps in complex queries, often for filtering results or performing calculations that are then used by the main query.
```sql
-- Example of subquery
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
---

### 51. What is a correlated subquery in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A correlated subquery is a subquery that references columns from the outer query. It is executed once for each row processed by the outer query and is used to perform row-by-row processing.
```sql
-- Example of correlated subquery
SELECT e1.name, e1.salary
FROM employees e1
WHERE e1.salary > (SELECT AVG(e2.salary) FROM employees e2 WHERE e2.department_id = e1.department_id);
```
---

### 52. What is the purpose of the COALESCE function in SQL?
**Answer:**  
The `COALESCE` function returns the first non-NULL value in a list of expressions. It is used to handle NULL values by providing a default value when NULLs are encountered.
```sql
-- Example of COALESCE function
SELECT name, COALESCE(salary, 0) AS salary
FROM employees;
```
---

### 53. What is a bitmap index in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A bitmap index is a type of index that uses bitmaps (binary arrays) to represent the existence of values in a table. Bitmap indexes are efficient for columns with a low cardinality (few distinct values) and are used to improve query performance.
```sql
-- Example of bitmap index (Oracle syntax)
CREATE BITMAP INDEX idx_employee_department ON employees(department_id);
```
---

### 54. What is the purpose of the ROW_NUMBER() function in SQL?
**Answer:**  
The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a result set. It is often used for pagination or to provide a unique identifier for rows in a query result.
```sql
-- Example of ROW_NUMBER() function
SELECT name, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
FROM employees;
```
---

### 55. What is the difference between RANK() and DENSE_RANK() in SQL?
**Answer:**  
- **RANK():** Assigns a rank to each row within a partition, with gaps in the ranking sequence for ties.
- **DENSE_RANK():** Assigns a rank to each row within a partition without gaps in the ranking sequence for ties.
```sql
-- Example of RANK() and DENSE_RANK() functions
SELECT name, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees;
```
---

### 56. What is the purpose of the CAST() function in SQL?
**Answer:**  
The `CAST()` function is used to convert an expression from one data type to another. It is commonly used to ensure that data types are compatible in expressions and comparisons.
```sql
-- Example of CAST() function
SELECT name, CAST(salary AS VARCHAR(10)) AS salary_str
FROM employees;
```
---

### 57. What is a materialized view in SQL?
**Answer:**  
A materialized view is a database object that stores the result of a query physically. It is used to improve query performance by precomputing and storing complex query results, reducing the need to recompute them each time.
```sql
-- Example of materialized view (Oracle syntax)
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW emp_dept_view AS
SELECT e.name, d.name AS department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```
---

### 58. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and CROSS JOIN?
**Answer:**  
- **INNER JOIN:** Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables based on the specified condition.
