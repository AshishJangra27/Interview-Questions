# 100 Essential SQL Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What is SQL?

**Answer:** SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, deleting data, and creating and modifying database structures.

## 2. What is a primary key?

**Answer:** A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a database table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and helps to establish relationships between tables. A primary key cannot contain NULL values.

## 3. What is a foreign key?

**Answer:** A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It creates a relationship between the two tables and enforces referential integrity.

## 4. What is a JOIN in SQL?

**Answer:** A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Common types of JOINs include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.

## 5. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?

**Answer:** 
- **INNER JOIN:** Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables involved in the join. If there are no matching rows, the result is null.
- **OUTER JOIN:** Includes all rows from one table and the matching rows from the other table. If there is no match, it returns null for the columns from the table without a match. This can be further divided into LEFT JOIN (all rows from the left table) and RIGHT JOIN (all rows from the right table).

## 6. What is a subquery?

**Answer:** A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It is used to perform intermediate steps in complex queries, often for filtering results or performing calculations that are then used by the main query.

## 7. How do you handle NULL values in SQL?

**Answer:** 
- **Using COALESCE:** Replace NULL values with a specified value.
- **Filtering out NULLs:** Use a condition in the WHERE clause to exclude rows with NULL values, e.g., `WHERE column IS NOT NULL`.

## 8. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?

**Answer:** 
- **DELETE:** Removes specified rows from a table based on a condition and can be rolled back if used within a transaction. It also fires any associated triggers.
- **TRUNCATE:** Removes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions and cannot be rolled back in most databases. TRUNCATE is faster than DELETE and resets any identity columns.

## 9. What is a stored procedure?

**Answer:** A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements stored in the database. It is used to encapsulate repetitive tasks, improve performance by reducing the need to compile SQL code multiple times, and enhance security by controlling access to data.

## 10. What is indexing in SQL?

**Answer:** Indexing is a technique used to improve the performance of SQL queries by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned. An index is created on a table column, and it helps the database to find rows more quickly and efficiently.
