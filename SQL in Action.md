**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT 
    sale_date, 
    product_id, 
    total_amount, 
    SUM(total_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY sale_date) AS cumulative_sales_amount
FROM 
    sales
ORDER BY 
    product_id, sale_date;
```

### 2. Find the top 3 products with the highest total sales amount.

**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT 
    product_id, 
    SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales_amount
FROM 
    sales
GROUP BY 
    product_id
ORDER BY 
    total_sales_amount DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### 3. Calculate the month-over-month sales growth for each product.

**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT 
    product_id,

    SUM(total_amount) AS monthly_sales,
    LAG(SUM(total_amount)) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date)) AS previous_month_sales,
    (SUM(total_amount) - LAG(SUM(total_amount)) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date))) / NULLIF(LAG(SUM(total_amount)) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date)), 0) * 100 AS month_over_month_growth
FROM 
    sales
GROUP BY 
    product_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date)
ORDER BY 
    product_id, month;
```

-- | 2           | Clothing      |
-- | 3           | Groceries     |

-- And a product_category table
-- product_category
-- | product_id | category_id |
-- |------------|-------------|
-- | 101        | 1           |
-- | 102        | 1           |
-- | 103        | 2           |
-- | 104        | 3           |
-- | 105        | 3           |

SELECT

    SUM(s.total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    sales s
JOIN 
    product_category pc ON s.product_id = pc.product_id
JOIN 
    categories c ON pc.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY 
    c.category_name;
```

    sales
GROUP BY 
    product_id;
```
---

### 9. Find the date with the highest total sales amount across all products.

**Answer:**
```sql
